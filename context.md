# User Stories

As a user

I want to plan my runs each week

Runs are in the following types - 3k, 5k, 10k, 15k, 20k

For each run I want to capture the time I took - so I should be able to tap the screen, start a timer and close the timer when I have hit the required distance

I want to track my runs - total runs Km and also for each week, month etc

Build a joyful and simple user interface

Put some motivational hooks in the app
